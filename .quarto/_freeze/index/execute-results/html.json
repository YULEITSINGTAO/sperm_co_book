While lifestyle adjustments and medical interventions hold potential to alleviate asthenospermia, its underlying mechanism remains elusive. Employing single-cell sequencing, we analyzed meiotic recombination in individual sperm cells from 30 males, comprising 11 with asthenospermia (AS) and 19 with normal fertility (NF). Our study unveiled the distribution of recombination events and identified recombination hotspots in male gametes. Recombination frequency declined with age in both NF and AS groups and correlated with key sperm movement characteristics such as total motility. The AS group exhibited not only a reduced recombination rate but also an elevated propensity to produce sperm with aneuploidy compared to the NF group. A genome-wide association study revealed novel genomic loci and closely positioned genes intricately associated with DNA crossover formation. These genes display an enrichment of energy metabolism and DNA-related activities, central to meiosis and gamete production. Our results suggest that an energy transformation deficiency within spermatogonia could potentially lead to reduced DNA recombination during meiosis, along with impaired sperm motility -- both hallmarks of males afflicted by asthenospermia.\n\nKeywords: asthenospermia; DNA recombination; genome-wide association study; meiosis; single sperm cell sequencing\n\n![Workflow for Comprehensive Analysis of Sperm Motility Characteristics and Recombination. In this study, we outline the comprehensive analysis workflow for assessing sperm motility characteristics and recombination. (A) Genome Profile Phase. During the genome profile phase, we collected blood samples and 4-5 sperm samples from asthenospermia donors (n = 19) and normal donors (n = 11). Bulk sequencing of blood samples was conducted at an approximate depth of 10x, while single-cell sequencing was performed on sperm cells at a depth of 1x. For each donor, fastq files from bulk blood sequencing and 4-5 sperm single-cell fastq files were generated as part of the genome profiling phase. (B) Individual-Level Crossover Detection Phase. During the individual-level crossover detection phase, the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) genotyping pipeline was employed to obtain the genotypes of both blood and sperm samples for each donor. Heterogeneous loci positions were extracted from the blood genotype profile and subsequently utilized as a reference for HAPI, enabling the identification of crossover events in each sperm sample. By the conclusion of this phase, both the blood genotype profile and the crossover event profiles for each sperm sample were generated. (C) Transcriptome Profiling Phase. In this phase, a second cohort consisting of sperm samples from asthenospermia donors (n = 7) and normal donors (n = 6) was collected. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to obtain the gene expression profiles of these samples. (D) Downstream Statistics Analysis Phase. In this phase, several key analyses were carried out, including crossover hotspot analysis, a comparison of crossovers between asthenospermia and normal sperm, an investigation into crossover frequency-associated loci, and a comparison study of critical genes.](Figures/s1.png)\n\n# Needed Packages\n\nLoad the needed packages.
